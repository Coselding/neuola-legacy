Neuola, NEUol's Article Management System
===========================================

The project aims to be a robust articale management system to build a news article site with ease.

## Installation & Test

Refer to [Wiki](https://github.com/yfwz100/neuola/wiki) for more information.

## Why legacy?

People coming from the original [URL][neuola-old] may be confused about the name of the repository. In fact, this project was created at the beginning of 2013. At that time many components are still under beta testing and I am just practicing how a site could be built on [node.js][].

The new code, developing since 2014, was splited into several decomposed components([neuola-admin][], [neuola-site][]), please feel free to try/improve them.
